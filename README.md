# How to Use

This app uses the smash.gg api. If you want to use it at it's current state go to smash.gg find a tournament and type it in the tournament input field. The game that is feature in that tournament will show in the select game field, but it's not functional for using. Type in a player from that tournament into the player 1 field and if that person appeared at that tournament that player's name will appear at the bottom. If that player didn't attend then "Player not found" will appear at the bottom. At the moment you can only pick players from certian melee tournaments. Tournaments I've tested so far and was able to select players from was "Evo 2017" and "Ceo 2017", so if you want to try it out you can search melee players from there and it should work fine.

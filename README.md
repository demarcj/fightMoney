## Where is it in development?

It's not finished, but at the moment I'm working on it everyday so hopely we can get alpha version of this within maybe 1 month at the least.
You can see the functionally of the app under the "Version" header.  

# How to Use

This app uses the smash.gg api. If you want to use it go to smash.gg find a tournament and type it in the tournament input field. Type in a player from that tournament into the player 1 field and if that person enter that tournament that the app will confirm it under the form. If that player didn't attend then "Player not found" will appear under the form.

## To-Do-List & what to expect next
- [ ] Create a dropdown box so that for the tournament and player input field so the user don't have to go to smash.gg to get that information
- [ ] Add Try Catch for entries that does not match with smash.gg database.
- [ ] Switch from smash.gg legacy api to the graphql version because at some point the legacy api might get delepleted 
- [ ] Change the whole app to TypeScript
- [ ] Import and set the Eslint setting
- [ ] Reorganinze the files and folder, and refactor the code to reflect my current style of naming convention 
- [ ] Change the favicon.ico file
